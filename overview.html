  <h1>About this site</h1>
  <p>This site summarizes the results of examining logs recorded in Windows upon execution of the 49 tools which are likely to be used by the attacker that has infiltrated a network. The following logs were examined. Note that it was confirmed that traces of tool execution is most likely to be left in event logs. Accordingly, examination of event logs is the main focus here.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <ul>
      <li>Event Log</li>
      <li>Execution history</li>
      <li>Prefetch</li>
      <li>USN Journal</li>
      <li>MFT</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Note that a sufficient amount of event logs cannot be acquired with the default Windows settings. In this research, logs that are recorded with the following settings were examined.</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <ul>
      <li>Audit policy enabled</li>
      <li>Sysmon installed</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>For instruction on how to enable the audit policy and install Sysmon, see the <a href="http://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/pub/sr/ir_research.html" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
